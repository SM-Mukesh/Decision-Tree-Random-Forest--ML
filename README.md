# Decision-Tree-Random-Forest--ML
Machine Learning Models with Decision Tree and Random Forest

## Model-1
### Objective:
  To build Machine Learning Models with Decision Tree and Random Forest Algorithm for Kyphosis Dataset
  
### About Data:
  The Dataset represents the number of patients who had "Kyphosis" which is a spinal condition and then they had a operation.The Operation was a corrective spinal surgery.
The Dataset tells us if Kyphosis is Present or absent after the surgery

Features:
* Kyphosis:'present' or 'absent (Target)
* Age: In months
* Number: The number of vertebrae involved in the operation
* Start: The number of the first or the top most vertebrae that was operated
